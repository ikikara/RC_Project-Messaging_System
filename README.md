## Description
This project was developed for Communication Networks subject @University of Coimbra, Informatics Engineering <br>
Consists in develop a program that implements a Messaging System using UNIX specification and network elements like sockets and the protocols TCP and UDP. This system implements some types of communication like Client-Server, Peer-to-Peer and (almost) Multicast.

#### Main Languages:

## Technologies used:
1. C ([documentation](https://devdocs.io/c/))
2. [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/software/download)

## To run this project:
You have one way to run this project:
1. Using GNS3 and containers inside:
    * We will use some materials on GNS3, 5 containers (with Linux in this case), 3 routers and 3 switches
    * Replicate the image above and config some IP's and route's between networks (information about this on "1st_Goal_Report.pdf")
      ![image](https://i.imgur.com/f0r67j7.png)
    * Download the folder "src" and file Registos.txt that is on "resources" folder
    * On container called "Server" compile and run the file server.c
      ```shellscript
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> gcc server.c -o server
      ```
      ```shellscript 
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> ./server 80 160 Registos.txt
      ```
    * On others containers compile and run the file client.c
      ```shellscript
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> gcc client.c -o client
      ```
      ```shellscript 
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> ./client 192.136.212.251 80   (for a normal user)
      ```
      
      ```shellscript 
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> ./client 192.136.212.251 160  (for an admin user)
      ```
    * Finally use the program as you want!

## Notes important to read:
- The containers used were provided with the image of Ubuntu VM that I used to do this project. Because this was provided by my teacher/course I can't make it available, so try to create a container on gns3 that use Linux (don't look at me I don't know how to do it xd)
- The routers were Cisco 2600 and again the image for these routers were provided by my teacher/course, so again I can't make it available, try to find one :'))
- File "Registos.txt" must be on same folder as "server.c" on "Server" container
